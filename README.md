# chat-app-mern
This is a simple chat application with the following functionality: 

1. User registration, 
2. User login with JSON Web Token validation
3. Ability to create chat rooms on certain topics and add/remove users to/from these rooms
4. Client side is written in React JS
5. Server side is written in Node js using Express js. 
6. MongoDB is used as the database. 
7. Application styles use components of ChakraUI library
8. Also, I used socket.io for real-time communication between the chat members
